  <h2>parts of a url</h2>
  <dl>scheme</dl>
  <dt>The scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. It can be HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL).</dt>
  <dl>host</dl>
  <dt>The host name identifies the host that holds the resource. For example, www.example.com. A server provides services in the name of the host, but hosts and servers do not have a one-to-one mapping. Refer to Host names.
Host names can also be followed by a port number. Refer to Port numbers. Well-known port numbers for a service are normally omitted from the URL. Most servers use the well-known port numbers for HTTP and HTTPS , so most HTTP URLs omit the port number.</dt>
<dl>path</dl>
<dt>The path identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. For example, /software/htp/cics/index.html.</dt>
<dl>quarry string</dl>
<dt>If a query string is used, it follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can use for some purpose (for example, as parameters for a search or as data to be processed). The query string is usually a string of name and value pairs; for example, term=bluebird. Name and value pairs are separated from each other by an ampersand (&); for example, term=bluebird&source=browser-search.
